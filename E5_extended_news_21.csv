U.N. peacekeepers in Mali withdraw from two bases in the north as fighting intensifies,"BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — United Nations peacekeepers started departing from two bases in northern Mali Monday as part of a forced withdrawal from the country amid increasing insecurity and a rise in attacks by Islamic extremists.  The U.N. mission said it wanted to complete its departure quickly from two camps in the Kidal region, Tessalit and Aguelhok. Attacks in northern Mali have more than doubled since the peacekeepers completed the first phase of their withdrawal in August.  “In view of the rapidly deteriorating security conditions for the lives of hundreds of peacekeepers … the mission is doing its utmost to complete this process as soon as possible, including if necessary, accelerating its withdrawal from the Kidal camp, originally scheduled for mid-November,” a UN statement said.  Earlier this year, Mali’s military junta ordered the U.N. mission to leave the country, which has struggled to contain an Islamic extremist insurgency since 2012. The operation in Mali became one of the most dangerous in the world, with more than 150 peacekeepers killed since it began operations in 2013.  READ MORE: Mali military camp attacked a day after al-Qaida-linked assault kills 49 civilians and 15 soldiers  Violence is spiking between ethnic Tuareg rebels, known as the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security and Development (CSP-PSD) and Mali’s military. Analysts say the uptick signals the breakdown of a 2015 peace agreement signed between the government and the rebels who once drove security forces out of northern Mali as they sought to create the state of Azawad.  Earlier this month the rebels said they captured another military base from the army in the north.  On Monday, Mali’s military said on X, formerly Twitter, that its aircraft came under heavy fire as it approached Tessalit’s airport. The army neutralized the enemy and the aircraft was able to land and take off without problems, it said.  Compounding the rebel violence are increasing attacks by Islamic extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, which have wracked the country for a decade and led to two coups.  Extremist rebels were forced from power in the West African nation’s northern cities in 2013 with the help of a French-led military operation. But the insurgents regrouped in the desert and began launching attacks on the Malian army and its allies.  The U.N. peacekeepers came in a few months later in what has become one of the most dangerous U.N. missions in the world.",1,2023-10-17,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-n-peacekeepers-in-mali-withdraw-from-two-bases-in-the-north-as-fighting-intensifies?
Wall Street indexes rally after Fed cuts interest rates,"Dec 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point as expected and investors bet on further easing down the road even as the central bank signaled that it will put further cuts on pause for now. The central bank said that before its next policy change it would look ahead for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that ""remains somewhat elevated.""  But projections after the Fed's two-day meeting showed median expectations for another quarter-point cut in 2026, in line with expectations at the September meeting. And policymakers raised estimates for 2026 GDP growth to 2.3% from 1.8% and maintained expectations for a 4.4% unemployment rate at the end of next year. In his press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to provide guidance on whether there will be another rate cut in the near future. However, investors garnered some hope for easing from his comments that the labor market has significant downside risks and that the central bank doesn't want its policy to push down on job creation.  ""The market may have found some solace in the Powell's downbeat labor market discussion - a bad news is good news situation, to support more cuts next year,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at 248 Ventures in Charlotte, North Carolina adding that U.S. Treasury yields ""lost some steam as Powell spoke, which helps support stock upside."" The market had been muted ahead of the statement as investors, while widely expecting a cut, were concerned the Fed would take a more hawkish tone on the policy outlook. And even before Powell's comments some investors were eyeing more potential for rate cuts due to labor market concerns. ""The statement emphasized weakness in the labor market as the principal rationale for the 25 basis point cut, and this detail is what the market has picked up on, suggesting the Fed could continue easing policy, even though the expectations for easing in 2026 haven’t changed with one 25 basis point priced in,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer, Angeles Investments.",1,2025-12-10,https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-futures-slip-ahead-fed-meeting-2026-cuts-doubt-2025-12-10/
What can we expect as fire season ramps up in California?,"Officials and scientists say the state has had a mild season thus far, but fires are expected to surge in drier months.  As the United States enters its hottest months of the year, fire officials and scientists say they are preparing for wildfire activity to ramp up.  While the US fire season typically runs from late spring until early autumn, experts say the most intense fires tend to erupt in months like July and August, when temperatures are high and vegetation is dried out.  California has become emblematic of the scope and intensity of those wildfires. The western state tallied 8,110 blazes in 2024 alone — more than any other part of the country.  Just last week, the insurance company Gallagher Re found that two blazes this year in the Los Angeles area — the Eaton and Palisades fires — were responsible for nearly $40bn in insured losses alone. An estimated 30 people died in those fires.  That toll has put California in the crosshairs of a nationwide debate about how best to deal with wildfires and what the state and federal roles should be.  Earlier this month, on the six-month anniversary of the deadly infernos, US Senator Alex Padilla called on the federal government to invest more in fire preparedness, rather than scale back, as President Donald Trump has suggested he may do.  “We’re entering the next peak fire season. Fire season is year-round in California, but peak fire season is just beginning,” Padilla said.  He pointed out that the Los Angeles conflagrations sparked in the relatively mild month of January: “These fires took place in wintertime, not in the hot dry months of summer.”  That, experts say, is an indication of the potential scale of California’s wildfires, even under less-than-ideal circumstances.  Potential for a ‘fairly severe’ season Scientists say that California’s wildfires have been fairly subdued so far this year, but they are expected to pick up as summer progresses into August, especially in parts of the state that have struggled with drought in recent months.  “We’ve had a number of small-to-medium-sized fires, but nothing too startling so far,” Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), told Al Jazeera in a recent phone call.  “But that’s kind of where we’d expect to be at this point in the season. And we’ve seen some factors that point to what could be a fairly severe fire season as we enter the drier months.”  Scientists are quick to stress that wildfire seasons can be affected by a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.  Events associated with wildfire, such as periods of high winds, extreme heat or lightning storms, are themselves mercurial. Acts of human error or negligence, like a downed power line or a failure to properly extinguish a campfire, can also set a landscape ablaze.  Once a burn starts, elements like wind strength and firefighter access can make the difference between a fire that is quickly snuffed out and one that grows larger and more intense.  “It’s really hard to come up with a single rationale for why some seasons are so much more intense than others,” said Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science and forest policy at the University of California, Berkeley.  The fire seasons of 2020 and 2021 in California, for example, saw record-breaking fires that spread across enormous portions of land.  The next several years were, by comparison, fairly tame, although scientists say that factors such as climate change have contributed to fire seasons that see higher-than-average levels of activity.  But there are some indicators that scientists and fire officials look to as clues, such as the prevalence of drought and the level of moisture present in soil and plant life. While many catalysts can spark a fire, how quickly it spreads and how unstoppable it becomes is largely a matter of fuel, in the form of thick, dry vegetation.  Stephens says that southern California’s chaparral landscape — typified by low-lying shrubs like sage — is especially prone to fire, and it has had a “very dry” year.  The US Drought Monitor says that about 23 percent of the state is currently experiencing conditions ranging from severe to exceptional drought, with many of those areas concentrated in southern California.  California’s largest fire of the year thus far, the Madre Fire, took place in San Luis Obispo County in central California and reached about 80,000 acres (32,400 hectares), according to the state agency Cal Fire.  That blaze is more than 95 percent contained, the term fire officials use to reference the portion of a fire effectively surrounded by protective lines built to stop it from spreading.",1,2025-07-23,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/23/what-can-we-expect-as-fire-season-ramps-up-in-california?
PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas,"Washington, D.C., March 31, 2025 (PAHO) – The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has issued a new epidemiological alert in response to an increase in yellow fever cases across the Americas during the first months of 2025. The number of confirmed human cases as of March 22 has more than doubled compared to the total recorded in all of 2024, raising concerns about a potential expansion of the disease.  In the first almost three months of 2025, 131 human cases have been confirmed, with 53 deaths. In comparison, 61 cases were reported throughout 2024, 30 of which were fatal. The cases are located in Bolivia (1 case, 1 death), Brazil (81 cases, 31 deaths), Colombia (31 cases, 13 deaths), and Peru (18 cases, 8 deaths), with cases reported beyond the traditionally affected Amazon region.  Particularly concerning are the new cases reported since October 2024 in the department of Tolima, Colombia, which indicates the virus is appearing in areas not previously affected in past years. In these regions, activities such as agriculture represent a risk factor for exposure to the virus. The increase in cases and their geographic spread highlights the urgent need to strengthen surveillance, prevention, and control measures to contain the disease.  In addition, the epidemiological situation in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with 34 cases and 19 deaths, is worrying due to its proximity to densely populated urban centers, increasing the risk of a larger outbreak.  Yellow fever is a serious viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, which can be fatal but is preventable through vaccination. The vast majority of the cases detected have involved individuals who were not vaccinated.  In an alert issued on March 27, PAHO calls for intensifying vaccination efforts in at-risk areas, aiming for coverage rates above 95%. Vaccination is the most effective tool to combat the disease. PAHO also recommends that countries review their vaccine stocks, ensure rapid response plans for outbreaks, and make sure travelers to endemic areas are informed and vaccinated.  Since the yellow fever epidemic in Brazil between 2016 and 2018, the public health threat of the disease has resurfaced in the Americas. The yellow fever virus remains in a sylvatic cycle between specific species of mosquitoes and non-human primates in 13 countries and territories of the region. Since 1960, it has caused 9,591 human cases and 3,444 deaths.  In February, based on the increase in cases across several countries during the last months of 2024 and the first weeks of 2025, PAHO published a risk assessment in which it considered the risk of yellow fever outbreaks in the region to be high.  PAHO will continue to monitor the situation and support countries in adopting the best strategies for preventing and controlling yellow fever.",1,2025-03-31,https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas?
NASA releases close-up pictures of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA unveiled close-up pictures on Wednesday of the interstellar comet that’s making a quick one-and-done tour of the solar system.  Discovered over the summer, the comet known as 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed object to visit our corner of the cosmos from another star. It zipped harmlessly past Mars last month.  Three NASA spacecraft on and near the red planet zoomed in on the comet as it passed just 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) away, revealing a fuzzy white blob. The European Space Agency’s two satellites around Mars also made observations.  Other NASA spacecraft will remain on the lookout in the weeks ahead, including the Webb Space Telescope. At the same time, astronomers are aiming their ground telescopes at the approaching comet, which is about 190 million miles (307 million kilometers) from Earth. The Virtual Telescope Project’s Gianluca Masi zoomed in Wednesday from Italy.  The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.  “Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a fascinating and rare opportunity,” said NASA’s acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman.  The closest the comet will come to Earth is 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) in mid-December. Then it will hightail it back into interstellar space, never to return.  READ MORE: NASA says new interstellar comet it spotted will keep a safe distance from Earth  ESA’s Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won’t get any of these observations back until February because Juice’s main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it’s near the sun, limiting the flow of data.  Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet (440 meters) across to 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own — “which gives me goose bumps to think about,” said NASA scientist Tom Statler.  “That means that 3I/Atlas is not just a window into another solar system, it’s a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,” Statler told reporters.  NASA officials were quick to dispel rumors that this friendly solar system visitor, as they called it, might be an alien ship of some sort. They said that because of the federal government shutdown, they weren’t able to respond to all the theories cropping up in recent weeks.  The space agency is always on the hunt for life beyond Earth, “but 3I/Atlas is a comet,” said NASA’s associate administrator, Amit Kshatriya.",1,2025-11-20,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/nasa-releases-close-up-pictures-of-interstellar-comet-3i-atlas?
"Mediterranean diet offsets genetic risk for dementia, study finds","New research suggests that following a Mediterranean-style diet may help offset a person’s genetic risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.  The study, published in Nature Medicine and led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease who followed a Mediterranean diet — rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and low in red and processed meats — showed slower cognitive decline as well as a greater reduction in dementia risk than those at lower genetic risk.  “One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial,” said study first author Yuxi Liu, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and the Broad. “We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions.”  “These findings suggest that dietary strategies could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways.”   Yuxi Liu, study’s first author Over the last few decades, researchers have learned more about the genetic and metabolic basis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. Alzheimer’s disease is known to have a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80 percent.  One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E, or APOE, has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease — the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. People who carry one copy of the APOE4 variant have a three- to fourfold higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s. People with two copies of the APOE4 variant have a 12-fold higher risk of Alzheimer’s than those without.  To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). To validate their findings, the researchers analyzed similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed from 1993 to 2023.  Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants’ blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant’s inherited risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.  They found that the people following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline. The protective effect of the diet was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.  “These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways,” Liu said. “This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant.”  A study limitation was that the cohort consisted of well-educated individuals of European ancestry. More research is needed in diverse populations.  In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer’s disease. People often don’t know their APOE genetics. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.  “In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk,” Liu said.",1,2025-08-25,https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/?
EU Parliament backs new 2040 climate target,"The European Parliament on Thursday approved the EU’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040 compared with 1990 levels and allows up to 5% of that target to be met using international carbon credits, paving the way for the measure to be passed into EU law.   The plan falls short of what the EU’s scientific advisers said is needed to align with the 1.5 °C global warming limit, as it includes the carbon credit flexibility, but it is still more ambitious than the commitments of many major economies.   EU countries’ climate ministers had already backed the proposal ahead of the COP30 climate summit.   The Parliament passed the measure with a majority of 379 in favour, 248 against and 10 abstentions. Members also rejected a proposal from the far-right Patriots for Europe group to scrap the climate target.   The plan’s use of international carbon credits means actual emissions cuts required from EU industries could be effectively closer to 85% from 1990 levels.",1,2025-11-13,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/eu-parliament-backs-new-2040-climate-target-2025-11-13/?
Russians still banned as the track and field world championships open in Tokyo,"TOKYO (AP) — Sebastian Coe, the head of World Athletics, on Friday said the organization is sticking to its long-held position that Russian athletes won’t be allowed at the upcoming world championships and other big events until a peace settlement is reached in its war in Ukraine.  Track and field’s hard-line stance is an outlier among Olympic sports, many of which allowed Russians to compete as neutral athletes at the Paris Olympics last year, and also at some world championships.  Russians have been almost completely absent from major international track meets for about a decade, dating to when they were sanctioned as the result of a doping scandal and the subsequent coverup that engulfed the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.  Not long after World Athletics lifted that ban in 2022, it enacted a new one related to Russia’s then-recent invasion of Ukraine.  “It’s pretty obvious that we want a full contingent,” Coe said on the eve of world championships, when asked if there were any changes to the Russia policy. “We need a settled position. We need a peaceful agreement before we can move off that landscape.”  The world championships will feature about 2,000 athletes from 200 countries. They’ll take place at Japan’s $1.4 billion National Stadium, which was built for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Those Games were delayed a year by the pandemic and eventually held in Tokyo — but without fans.  At those Olympics, World Athletics granted only 10 spots for Russians who competed as “Authorized Neutral Athletes.” Among them was Maria Lasitskene, who won the gold medal in high jump but has not competed in a major international event since.  “No, nothing has changed,” Coe said about the policy. “I hope to God that it does change -- not just for athletics -- because it’s an unsustainable situation.”",1,2025-09-12,https://apnews.com/article/russia-track-worlds-coe-ban-war-ukraine-04c055f3cbf0a00ffacfd478bf721ec9?
800 Miles on a Single Charge? China’s New Solid-State Battery Could Make It Happen,"Chinese automaker Chery has revealed a breakthrough solid-state battery module boasting 600 Wh/kg of energy density, nearly double that of today’s best lithium-ion EV packs. The company claims the technology could enable a driving range of up to 1,300 km (808 miles) on a single charge, setting a new benchmark in the race toward next-generation batteries.  The module was unveiled at Chery’s Global Innovation Conference in Wuhu, where the automaker detailed plans to begin pilot production in 2026 before ramping up to mass production in 2027. Using an in-situ polymerized solid electrolyte and a lithium-rich manganese cathode, the new design is said to deliver superior safety and energy density while resisting puncture and thermal runaway in lab tests.  Closing the Gap on Global Leaders Chery’s announcement positions it among the most ambitious players in the solid-state race. Other automakers are already advancing similar efforts: Toyota with its efforts for the first solid state battery due to release by 2027, targeting faster charging, greater longevity, and a new generation of lightweight electric models. Meanwhile, Mercedes with their efforts shows how German engineering is closing in from another front, with Mercedes demonstrating nearly 750 miles on a prototype EQS powered by a solid-state pack.  Chery’s approach could allow it to leapfrog both technologically and strategically. As China continues to dominate the global EV supply chain, a domestically developed 600 Wh/kg solution would solidify the country’s leadership in advanced energy storage, and could reshape expectations for affordability and range worldwide.  Why This Matters for the EV Market Solid-state batteries promise several key advantages: higher energy density, faster charging, improved safety, and greater durability. But they also pose major challenges in scaling and cost. Chery’s announcement, if realized, could dramatically reduce dependence on large battery packs and open new design possibilities for lighter, more efficient vehicles.  However, there’s a catch, infrastructure. Even if future EVs achieve 1,300 km of range, charging them efficiently will still depend on compatible networks. Most current vehicles can’t yet handle 600-kW charging speeds. Without matching progress on the grid and charging hardware, many of these range and speed benefits could remain theoretical.  A Glimpse Into the Electric Future If Chery can move from prototype to production as promised, it would mark one of the most significant energy density leaps in EV history. The company’s 1,300 km claim still awaits real-world verification, but it underscores the direction the industry is heading, to a future where range anxiety, charging downtime, and safety concerns may all become relics of the past.",1,2025-10-25,https://www.autoblog.com/news/800-miles-on-a-single-charge-chinas-new-solid-state-battery-could-make-it-happen?
UN chief urges countries to implement weather disaster warning systems,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries on Wednesday to implement disaster warning systems to protect people against extreme weather, saying no country was safe from the effects of global warming.   “Every one of the last 10 years has been the hottest in history. Ocean heat is breaking records while decimating ecosystems. And no country is safe from fires, floods, storms and heatwaves,” he told delegates at a U.N. World Meteorological Organization conference in Geneva marking the agency’s 75th year.   Guterres urged countries to mobilize funding to enable a global surveillance system, known as Early Warning Systems, to protect people from extreme weather.   “They give farmers the power to protect their crops and livestock. Enable families to evacuate safely. And protect entire communities from devastation,” Guterres said.   He added that getting notice 24 hours before a hazardous event can reduce damage by up to 30%.   Over 60% of countries have introduced multi-hazard Early Warning Systems since Guterres launched an initiative in 2022 for all countries to have these in place by 2027.   In the past five decades, weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people, with 90% of those deaths occurring in developing countries, the World Meteorological Organization said.   Guterres said developing countries were hindered in investing in warning systems by slowing growth and “crushing debt burdens.”   He urged countries meeting at next month’s U.N. Climate Conference in Brazil to agree a plan to unlock $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, and to deliver bold new national climate action plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade and limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C.",1,2025-10-22,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/global-warming-is-pushing-planet-brink-says-un-secretary-general-2025-10-22/?
Globalist Traitor John Bolton Arrested,"Former National Security Advisor and infamous Warhawk John Bolton was showering at his Bethesda, Maryland, residence Monday afternoon when his Secret Service detail rapped on the bathroom door and instructed him to dress immediately, for they had urgent information to share with him.  “Is it the Iranians? Bolton called out from the shower.  “Please get dressed, sir, it’s urgent,” a Secret Service agent replied.  Bolton, though never President or vice president, had requested Secret Service protection in 2019 over fears that Iranian assassins had marked him for death. Trump had granted the request, but then terminated Bolton’s detail after firing the traitorous Deep Stater later that year. In January 2021, Biden, having perpetrated election theft, reinstated Bolton’s detail, saying they’d safeguard him from both Iran and retaliation from Trump.  Bolton, ever the quintessential globalist, neocon, and warmonger, was the shortest-serving national security advisor in American politics; his tenure under Trump lasted from April 9, 2018 – September 10, 2019. Many Trump allies, including his eldest sons, felt Bolton was uniquely unqualified for the job and fundamentally dangerous. Besides competing with Trump for power, Bolton had advocated for dropping nuclear bombs on Iran and Syria or, at the very least, deposing those governments by way of prolonged air strikes and US boots on the ground. “Let’s shock and awe those motherfuckers back to the stone age, like Bush did to Iraq. Make America proud; be like Bush,” Bolton had told Trump. According to West Wingers, Bolton had often envisioned himself as President, doctored intelligence reports, and tried tenaciously to usurp Trump’s authority. After losing his job, Bolton authored several inflammatory books defaming President Trump.  When Bolton left the bathroom on Monday, he demanded to know why the Secret Service had interrupted his shower. The agents said they had bad news and catastrophic news and asked which he wanted to hear first.  “Just give me the bad news first,” Bolton answered belligerently.  “Effective immediately, President Trump has revoked your Secret Service privileges,” an agent told him.  Bolton huffed and puffed. “I’ll be defenseless before my enemies. If that’s the bad news, what’s the worst news?”  “You’re under arrest for treason,” the agent said flatly.  The agents’ announcement must have shaken Bolton to his core; two days earlier, they had been discussing their mutual hatred of Trump, his policies, and his desire to seek retribution against perceived enemies.  “There’s been a change in leadership,” an agent told Bolton. “And new directives.”  Handcuffed, Bolton asked the agents where they were taking him. He was told he’d be put in a holding cell until a military attaché showed up to take custody of him.",0,2025-01-24,https://realrawnews.com/2025/01/globalist-traitor-john-bolton-arrested/?
False report of Trump considering a 90-day tariff pause sends markets on a wild ride,"Stock markets went haywire on Monday morning as rumors of an impending tariff respite caused the S&P 500 to soar over 7%, and then give up nearly all those gains as the White House pronounced the rumor to be “fake news.” The episode, which began with a tweet around 10 a.m. ET, underscored both the current market skittishness as well as the peril of relying on social-media accounts.  The tweet in question came from an anonymous X account known as Walter Bloomberg (an apparent reference to the financial news service Bloomberg) that publishes a series of rapid-fire headlines. On Monday, the account tweeted that the director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, said President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs except China.  The report then spread like wildfire on social media and was briefly repeated by news outlets, including CNBC. One hour later, though, the White House issued its statement denying the report and, soon after, the Walter Bloomberg account deleted the tweet.  As markets fluctuated following the initial tweet, others on X—including a real Bloomberg journalist—began questioning the source of the news. In response, others shared another tweet from reporter Aaron Rupar that showed the Hassett news was based on a <em>Fox</em> News interview earlier that morning:  As the tweet above shows, Hassett’s comments offered little firm support for the claim that Trump was planning a 90-day tariff pause.  Meanwhile, others on social media took issue with the Walter Bloomberg account more broadly, and criticized him for failing to include a link or more detailed source to the “news”:  As of noon on Monday, the S&P index remained in the red, in part due to a fresh jolt in the form of a statement by President Trump that he intended to raise tariffs on China even higher.",0,2025-04-07,https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/trump-tariff-pause-walter-bloomberg-fake-report-debunked-markets/?
EXPOSED! WEF Insider Reveals LA Wildfires Were Engineered to Seize Land for 15-Minute Cities! Watch The People’s Voice Video,"The global elite have chosen Los Angeles as Ground Zero for a calculated assault on the people, paving the way for the rapid transformation of the disaster zone into 15-minute cities. These so-called “smart cities” are nothing more than vast outdoor prisons, designed to trap ordinary citizens with no way out.  This evil plan has been in the works for years, and now we are seeing it play out in all its grisly details before our very eyes.  The last five years have been a relentless psychological attack. It started with the chaos of COVID and has only escalated since – wars breaking out, the slow bleed of economic collapse, shameless price gouging, and the ever-tightening grip of authoritarianism.  We’re constantly under the cold, unflinching gaze of the surveillance state. Polarizing media narratives keep fueling division, dividing the people and baiting us toward civil unrest.  They won’t stop talking about “the next pandemic,” all while meddling with nature in reckless ways—gain-of-function experiments, self-replicating vaccines, and poisons in the air, water, and food.  And the worst part? They flaunt their power, making it painfully clear there’s nothing we can do to stop them.  Having brought their Covid series to an end, the globalist elite are moving onto their next phase. What’s next? The answer is mayhem. Total and utter mayhem.  We are barely one week into 2025 and already we have had terror attacks in America and direct-energy weapons orchestrating deadly wildfires in the heart of Los Angeles.  Make no mistake, these fires are not natural. They are the worst wildfires in LA history, and evidence is mounting that they were sparked by directed energy weapons deployed from Area 51.  Of course, Gavin Newsom has wasted no time blaming climate change, a more than convenient narrative for his Commiefornia government.  But there is just one problem. The wildfires are not behaving like normal fires. And they appear to be originating from Area 51 in Nevada, as In2ThinAir reports.  Just like before 9/11, major insurance companies seemed to know exactly what was coming, perfectly aligning their plans and pulling policies just before the fires devastated Los Angeles.  Insurance companies have now admitted to canceling fire policies on hundreds of thousands of homes in the Los Angeles area over the past few months, leaving countless families vulnerable and unprotected.  The mainstream media are desperate to dismiss these claims as conspiracy theories. But we now know for a fact that directed energy weapons are not conspiracy theories. They are conspiracy facts.  Just like in Maui, the areas hardest hit by the fires are those earmarked for transformation into 15-minute cities – projects pushed forward despite resistance from local homeowners.  The Palisades, the most devastated neighborhood, is not only set to host the 2028 Olympics but had already been designated as a future model smart city.  Now the land grab begins – and the global elite, led by WEF partners Blackrock and Vanguard, are leading the charge to acquire the land and begin building 15 minute cities.  In the months ahead, land owned by families for generations will be ripped away from them, stolen right from beneath their charred homes. And to add insult to injury, FEMA will offer them $70 as compensation.  The elite are brazen. They are not even trying to pretend this wasn’t a giant set up. Governor Newsom blocked the release of vital water from mountain reservoirs, depriving firefighters of a critical resource. For over two decades, Democrats have refused to maintain fire mitigation systems or clear brush from high-risk areas, allowing these tinderboxes to grow unchecked.  Meanwhile, the Biden administration imposed a no-fly zone over LA, grounding state and local firefighting aircraft in the midst of the inferno.  Adding insult to injury, LA’s newly appointed DEI-focused fire chief openly stated her priority was enforcing diversity quotas—not fighting fires or managing disasters. This same chief supported slashing $17.5 million from the fire department’s budget.  Where is Mayor Karen Bass, you ask? She was in Ghana on a tax-payer funded junket while her city burned, refusing to address the crisis or even acknowledge the displaced victims upon her return.  To top it off, the LA City Council has spent the last two years diverting a significant portion of the firefighting budget—and even equipment—to Ukraine, leaving their own city woefully unprepared for this disaster.  This isn’t negligence; it’s a betrayal. And according to a WEF insider, its all by design and there is much worse to come.  The globalist war on our health went into overdrive with the Covid plandemic, and now the elite have reached the next phase of their long heralded plan.  In the occult beliefs held by the elite, fire is seen as a force of purification.",0,2025-01-10,https://amg-news.com/exposed-wef-insider-reveals-la-wildfires-were-engineered-to-seize-land-for-15-minute-cities-watch-the-peoples-voice-video/?
"IRS Approves $2,000 Direct Deposit for December 2025 – Eligibility, Payment Dates & Full Claim Guide","The end of 2025 brings a major financial update for millions of Americans as the IRS prepares to roll out a $2,000 direct deposit payment in December 2025.

Northam platinum: Zelensky’s surprising move into the mining industry,"Volodymyr Zelensky has acquired a controlling 51% stake in Northam Platinum Ltd, a top South African mining company, in a deal worth around 27 billion rands. This marks one of the largest mining acquisitions in South Africa in recent years.  Sources close to the transaction suggest that Zelensky, through a network of private investors and holding companies, secured a 51% stake in Northam Platinum. While details of the purchase remain largely undisclosed, the controlling stake is believed to be valued at around 27 billion rands, making it the largest deal in the South African mining sector in recent years.  Under Zelensky’s influence, Northam Platinum may undergo changes in its operations, labor policies, and global partnerships. The deal could also strengthen Ukraine’s economic ties with Africa, opening new trade and investment opportunities. Experts suggest that this move could reshape the mining sector’s international dynamics. Platinum is a key material in the automotive and aerospace industries, making the acquisition a potentially significant asset for Ukraine’s future development.  Zelensky's upcoming visit to South Africa on April 10 is expected to draw significant international attention. His discussions with local leaders and industry stakeholders will likely set the tone for Ukraine's future economic cooperation with Africa.",0,2025-03-27,https://archive.is/RhO1N#selection-2645.0-2649.251
WEF Admits Disease X Will Be Leaked in 2025,"Last week, global elites met at the WEF Davos summit where the key topic of discussion was “Preparing for Disease X,”1 a hypothetical new deadly pandemic predicted to emerge in 2025 and kill 20 times more people than COVID-19.2 As reported by the Mirror:3  “The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of a potential Disease X since 2017, a term indicating an unknown pathogen that could cause a serious international epidemic …  Public speakers at the ‘Preparing for Disease X’ event next Wednesday [January 17, 2024] include Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, Brazilian minister of health Nisia Trindade Lima, and Michel Demaré, chair of the board at AstraZeneca.  In their first post-pandemic meeting held in November 2022, the WHO brought over 300 scientists to consider which of over 25 virus families and bacteria could potentially create another pandemic.  The list the team came up with included: the Ebola virus, the Marburg virus disease, Covid-19, SARS, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Others included lassa fever, nipah and henipaviral diseases, zift Valley fever, and zika — as well as the unknown pathogen that would cause ‘Disease X.’”  Mercola.com reports: I’ve interviewed Meryl Nass about how the WHO is trying to take over aspects of everyone’s lives. She just published an important piece over the weekend, Why Is Davos So Interested in Disease? about how the WEF and the WHO have become partners to terrify the world.   In a January 11, 2024, tweet, Fox News analyst and former assistant secretary for public affairs for the U.S. Treasury Department, Monica Crowley, wrote:4  “From the same people who brought you COVID-19 now comes Disease X: Next week in Davos, the unelected globalists at the World Economic Forum will hold a panel on a future pandemic 20x deadlier than COVID …  Just in time for the election, a new contagion to allow them to implement a new WHO treaty, lock down again, restrict free speech and destroy more freedoms. Sound far-fetched? So did what happened in 2020. When your enemies tell you what they’re planning and what they’re planning FOR, believe them. And get ready.”  Dr. Stuart Ray, vice chair of medicine for data integrity and analytics at Johns Hopkins’ Department of Medicine, dismissed such warnings, telling Fortune magazine5 that “Coordination of public health response is not conspiracy, it’s simply responsible planning.”   I’d be willing to believe him if it wasn’t for a now-obvious trend: Whatever the globalists claim will happen actually does happen at a remarkable frequency, and their prognostic capabilities become easier to explain when you consider that most lethal pandemics have been caused by manmade viruses, the products of gain-of-function research. It’s pretty easy to predict a new viral outbreak if you have said virus waiting in the wings.  With that in mind, recent research from China certainly raises concern, to say the least. According to a January 3, 2024, preprint,6 a SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin coronavirus — described as a “cell culture-adapted mutant” called GX_P2V that was first cultured in 2017 — was found to kill 100% of the humanized mice (ACE2-transgenic mice) infected with it.7  The primary cause of death was brain inflammation. According to the authors, “this is the first report showing that a SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin coronavirus can cause 100% mortality in hACE2 mice, suggesting a risk for GX_P2V to spill over into humans.”  However, if this virus mutated as a result of passaging through cell cultures, then it’s not likely to emerge in the wild. It’s another unnatural lab creation, so rather than saying it may spill over from pangolins to humans, it would be more accurate to admit that it may pose a (rather serious) risk to humans were a lab escape to occur.  COVID Dress Rehearsals In 2017, Johns Hopkins Center of Health Security held a coronavirus pandemic simulation called the SPARS Pandemic 2025-2028 scenario.8 Importantly, the exercise stressed “communication dilemmas concerning medical countermeasures that could plausibly emerge” in a pandemic scenario.  Then, in October 2019, less than three months before the COVID-19 outbreak, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in collaboration with Johns Hopkins and the World Economic Forum hosted Event 201.  The name itself suggests it may have been a continuation of the SPARS Pandemic exercise. College courses are numbered based on their prerequisites. A 101 course does not require any prior knowledge whereas 201 courses require prior familiarity with the topic at hand.  As in the SPARS Pandemic scenario, Event 201 involved an outbreak of a highly infectious coronavirus, and the primary (if not sole) focus of the exercise was, again, how to control information and keep “misinformation” in check, not how to effectively discover and share remedies.  Social media censorship played a prominent role in the Event 201 plan, and in the real-world events of 2020 th",0,2024-01-23,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/wef-admits-disease-x-will-be-leaked-in-2025/?
WEF Orders U.S. Electors To Not Certify Trump’s 2024 Election Win,"According to the WEF-funded publication The Atlantic, Democrats must prepare to refuse to certifiy the 2024 election in November.  The WEF mouthpiece put out an article Friday titled, “How Democrats Could Disqualify Trump If the Supreme Court Doesn’t“, outlining a strategy for Democrats to defy the election results if they don’t get their way.  Infowars.com reports: The editorial lamented the Supreme Court’s recent hearing on the 14th Amendment over Colorado’s unprecedented ruling to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot, and claimed Democrats may have to find another way to stop Trump outside the democratic process.  From The Atlantic: Without clear guidance from the Court, House Democrats suggest that they might not certify a Trump win on January 6.  Sensing that Trump would likely stay on the ballot, the attorney, Jason Murray, said that if the Supreme Court didn’t resolve the question of Trump’s eligibility, “it could come back with a vengeance”—after the election, when Congress meets once again to count and certify the votes of the Electoral College.  Murray and other legal scholars say that, absent clear guidance from the Supreme Court, a Trump win could lead to a constitutional crisis in Congress. Democrats would have to choose between confirming a winner many of them believe is ineligible and defying the will of voters who elected him. Their choice could be decisive: As their victory in a House special election in New York last week demonstrated, Democrats have a serious chance of winning a majority in Congress in November, even if Trump recaptures the presidency on the same day. If that happens, they could have the votes to prevent him from taking office.  In interviews, senior House Democrats would not commit to certifying a Trump win, saying they would do so only if the Supreme Court affirms his eligibility. But during oral arguments, liberal and conservative justices alike seemed inclined to dodge the question of his eligibility altogether and throw the decision to Congress.  This is just the latest example of Democrats projecting their intention to defy the will of the voters if Trump wins the 2024 election.  Last month, NBC News reported that “a loose-knit network of public interest groups and lawmakers” are preparing to “foil any efforts” for Trump to use the military to carry out his political agenda if he becomes Commander-in-Chief once again.  Democrats should expect to go to prison in D.C. for 22 years for trying to overturn the election since they’ve set the precedent by jailing nonviolent J6 protesters for speaking out against the rigged 2020 election.

Marines Arrest Victoria Nuland and Husband,"United States Marines on Monday arrested warmonger and top Deep State Department official Victoria Nuland, enforcing a military arrest warrant that charges the vile woman with treason and seditious conspiracy, crimes for which she will likely be executed, if convicted.  The arrest occurred Monday morning on the outskirts of D.C. at Nuland’s palatial estate. Sources in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News that she and her husband, historian Robert Kagan, had just seated themselves for breakfast when a Marine scout/sniper squad stormed the home, tranquilized Nuland’s taxpayer-funded security detail, and arrested both Nuland and Kagan, the latter as a co-conspirator to Nuland’s villainy.  “Kagan is criminally complicit,” the source said.  According to an after-action report reviewed by RRN, Nuland watched in horror as her security guards dropped one by one, then demanded that Kagan, a portly 65-year-old misanthrope, protect her. But Kagan wasn’t feeling so chivalrous. Rather than defend his wife, he blurted “oh, shit” and tried unsuccessfully to flee the residence, abandoning his shrieking spouse. He was struck in the back by a Taser and tranquilizer darts as he tottered to a rear door. Nuland gawked in stunned silence as her cowardly husband collapsed beneath his weight to the floor. She then chose pragmatism over idealism, holding her empty hands high above her head and begging the Marines to take her into custody unharmed. She had not, however, resigned entirely to an ineluctable fate; she told the Marines that Biden and Obama—her earlier master–would avenge her. The Marines subdued Nuland and cleared the house, seizing electronic devices before they left with the unconscious couple. They left the three paralyzed security guards behind.  Almost immediately after the arrest, the Deep State Department announced that Nuland would soon retire from politics. Our source said the announcement was characteristic of how the Deep State rationalizes the sudden disappearance of high-ranking officials to the public.  “The illegitimate administration isn’t going to admit the swamp is getting drained. And their MSM allies won’t either. If they did, they’d appear weak, rudderless, and ineffectual to their constituents. So, they make up these retirement and hospitalization stories to obscure the truth. The only place Nuland’s retiring to is GITMO, and hopefully the gallows,” our source said.  Nuland, he added, was so entrenched in the Deep State that they would probably kill her had she written a resignation letter.  The military’s indictment against Nuland is encyclopedic. It alleges she had overseen and micromanaged U.S. bioweapon laboratories in Ukraine. Moreover, it asserts that Nuland and Kagen were kingpins in the illegal production and distribution of Adrenochrome flowing between the United States and Eastern Europe. If all charges are valid, Nuland also had a role in the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline and, years and years ago, managed Obama’s infamous enemies list.  “And there’s a lot more beyond that, but I don’t know if Adm. Crandall will introduce every crime she’s committed. A military tribunal like that could take a year! Still, you know, there is no defense for what Nuland’s done, and I imagine any panel will see that quickly,” our source said.  In closing, he said Nuland and Kagan will face individual tribunals.",0,2024-03-07,https://realrawnews.com/2024/03/marines-arrest-victoria-nuland-and-husband/?
Bill Gates and WHO Call For Military To Round Up mRNA Vaccine Refusers During Bird Flu Pandemic,"Bill Gates has joined forces with the World Health Organization in calling for vaccine refusers to be rounded up by the military and force-jabbed with mRNA during the next pandemic.  Gates and the WHO have ordered governments to lay the groundwork to mobilize the military because they claim that vaccine skepticism is “morally reprehensible” and vaccine refusal is an “act of aggression” that must be met with force.  Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel on Rumble, join the People’s Voice Locals community to be part of our incredible team.  Bill Gate and the Dr Tedros of the globalist World Health Organization have announced a new project to turbo-charge the development and distribution of mRNA vaccines for an apparently looming bird flu pandemic.  However, the elite are rattled by the wave of vaccine skepticism which has spread around the United States and the world in the wake of the disastrous Covid mRNA vaccine roll out.  As more people refuse to submit to their vaccines, the elite are working on new and authoritarian ways to force their slew of new injectibles into our bodies without our consent.  A prominent Bill Gates-funded funded doctor has called for police forces and the military to be deployed as part of an effort to deal with what the pharmaceutical elite are now calling “anti-vaccine aggression.”  According to Dr. Peter Hotez, a close associate of Bill Gates and Dr. Tedros, they are now pushing to get NATO on board with militarizing the next mRNA vaccine roll out around the world.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have provided Dr. Hotez with tens of millions of dollars in funding to produce experimental vaccines.  As well as lining his own pockets, Hotez used the money to develop the Corbevax COVID-19 vaccine, which was administered in India, the country Bill Gates’ considers his personal laboratory.  Yet Dr. Hotez is terrified of having his pro-vaccine authoritarianism challenged in public.  The Bill Gates ally is on record stating that anybody criticizing vaccines should be charged with a hate crime. Yes, really.  The pro-vaccine elite do not like criticism and they do not like public debate.  Joe Rogan invited Hotez to appear on his podcast to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine controversy with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been exposing the truth about the vaccine since it was first rolled out.  The exchange began over Hotez sharing and promoting a Vice article that called on Spotify to censor Joe Rogan’s show whenever he dares to criticize vaccines or question the official narrative.  Once Rogan caught wind of what Hotez tweeted, he replied to him by offering to donate $100,000 to a charity of Hotez’s choice if he would debate RFK Jr. on his show.  “Peter, if you claim what RFKjr is saying is “misinformation” I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you’re willing to debate him on my show with no time limit,” Rogan tweeted.  Hotez replied to Rogan, stating that he had his contact information.  “Joe, you have my cell, my email, I’m always willing to speak with you,” the tweet read.  things took a quick turn once Twitter’s CEO and owner of Tesla, Elon Musk, jumped into the exchange, saying that Hotez is afraid to face a public debate.  “He’s afraid of a public debate, because he knows he’s wrong,” Musk tweeted.  Following Musk’s tweet, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman replied stating, “I will add $150,000 to @joerogan‘s wager so now $250,000 can go to charity and the public can hear an open debate on an important topic.”  And yet Hotez, who wants to use the military to round up and force-jab vaccine refusers, still refused to debate RFK Jr on the topic of Covid-19 vaccines.  Why are these far-left authoritarians so confident in calling for an end to medical freedom and liberty in the US, yet terrified to have their ideas examined in public?  According to a Health and Human Services whistleblower, it’s because they know the global elite are making moves behind the scenes to eradicate the freedom to dissent once and for all.  Rounding up millions of vaccine refusers and dissidents against the globalist agenda might sound like an impossible task.  Until you understand the Biden administration has been laying the groundwork to make this a reality for the past 12 months.  A whistleblower who worked for the Department of Health and Human Services has revealed the US government in collaboration with the World Economic Forum is building secret detention facilities in 50 states capable of detaining millions of people.  According to Christie Hutcherson, these prison-like compounds located in sparsely populated and controlled locations, will be used for those who refuse to comply with upcoming government mandates and regulations regarding long-term lockdowns and new vaccines for the new plandemic.",0,2024-08-01,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/bill-gates-and-who-call-for-military-to-round-up-mrna-vaccine-refusers-during-bird-flu-pandemic/?
"Breaking: NFL Team Kansas City Chiefs Refuses To Participate In Pride Month, “It’s Extremely Woke”","In a surprising and controversial decision, the Kansas City Chiefs, one of the NFL’s most prominent teams, have announced that they will not be participating in Pride Month celebrations this year. The team has stated that they find the event “extremely woke,” sparking a widespread debate and drawing both praise and criticism from various quarters.  The announcement was made through an official statement released by the Chiefs’ front office, stating their stance clearly and unequivocally. The statement read, “While we support diversity and inclusion, we believe that the current iteration of Pride Month has become overly politicized and does not align with our team’s values. We have therefore decided not to participate in any Pride Month events or celebrations this year.”  The immediate impact of this decision was felt across the sports world and beyond. Fans, players, and various organizations quickly took to social media to express their views. Some praised the Chiefs for standing up against what they perceive as excessive political correctness, while others condemned the decision as a step backward in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion.  Reactions have been polarized. Supporters of the Chiefs’ decision argue that the team is taking a principled stand against what they see as the overreach of “woke” culture into every aspect of life, including sports. They believe that sports should be a neutral ground where fans of all backgrounds can come together without the intrusion of political or social agendas.  One fan tweeted, “Finally, a team that isn’t afraid to stand up against the woke mob. Sports should be about the game, not politics.” This sentiment was echoed by many who feel that the increasing involvement of social and political issues in sports is detracting from the enjoyment of the game.  On the other hand, critics of the decision argue that the Chiefs are missing an important opportunity to show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and promote inclusivity. They point out that sports have a significant cultural impact and can be a powerful platform for advocating positive social change.  One prominent critic, GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), issued a statement saying, “The Kansas City Chiefs’ decision not to participate in Pride Month sends a harmful message to LGBTQ+ fans and players. Inclusion and representation matter, and the NFL has a responsibility to support all its fans and players.”  Historically, sports have often played a critical role in social change. From Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball to Muhammad Ali’s outspoken activism, athletes and sports organizations have frequently been at the forefront of major social movements. Many believe that the current era, with its emphasis on diversity and inclusion, is no different.  The NFL itself has made significant strides in promoting inclusivity, with various teams participating in Pride Month events, wearing rainbow-themed merchandise, and supporting LGBTQ+ causes. The Chiefs’ decision stands in stark contrast to this trend and raises questions about the direction the league as a whole will take in the future.  The Chiefs’ refusal to participate in Pride Month is not just a statement about their views on the event itself but also reflects a broader stance on the intersection of sports and politics. The team has positioned itself as standing against what it sees as the politicization of sports, arguing that fans come to games to escape the divisive issues of the day and enjoy the sport.  However, this stance is not without its complications. The refusal to participate in Pride Month can be seen as taking a political stance in itself, one that aligns the team with more conservative viewpoints. This can alienate a portion of their fan base and create divisions within the team and its supporters.  The NFL has yet to issue an official response to the Chiefs’ decision, but it is likely that the league will face pressure to address the controversy. Other teams in the league have continued to participate in Pride Month celebrations, emphasizing their commitment to diversity and inclusion.  The Chiefs’ decision also puts pressure on other teams to clarify their positions on social issues. In an increasingly polarized social climate, where actions are scrutinized and can have significant public relations consequences, teams may find themselves needing to take clear stances on issues they might have previously avoided.  As the Chiefs navigate the fallout from their decision, they will need to address the concerns of both their supporters and critics. The team will have to find a way to reconcile their stance with the need to foster an inclusive environment for all fans and players.  This situation also serves as a reminder of the complex role that sports play in society. While some argue that sports should remain separate from politics and social issues, the reality is that sports have always been intertwined ",0,2024-06-06,https://spacexmania.com/breaking-nfl-team-kansas-city-chiefs-refuses-to-participate-in-pride-month-its-extremely-woke144/?
"Allahu Akbar' Replaces 'Cheerio, Mate!' As Most Popular UK Greeting","LONDON — A recent poll conducted by the University of Oxford just revealed that ""Allahu Akbar"" has officially replaced ""Cheerio, mate!"" as the most popular greeting in the UK.
